config EXAMPLES_WATCHER
	tristate "Watcher example"
	default n
	---help---
		Enable the watcher example. The watcher is a task that will monitor
		other tasks that have previously subscribed to be watched. If the 
		watched tasks don't signal the watcher during the watchdog time period,
		the watchdog timer will expire and the watcher will print the tasks that
		did not signal and the ones that signaled. This example will only be supported
		by the chips that supports interrupt on timeout, i.e., which have the \"capture\"
		command implemented.
